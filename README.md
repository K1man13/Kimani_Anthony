# Kimani Anthony Portfolio

A personal portfolio showcasing my work as a multi-skilled creative and developer. This single-page site is the front door to my professional world—clean, functional, and packed with what I bring to the table.

## What’s This About?

This portfolio highlights my expertise across design, development, and storytelling. It’s built to introduce me, display my services, feature key projects, and make it easy to connect.

### Key Sections
- **Header/Hero**: Quick intro with my roles (Designer, Developer, etc.) and a CV download.
- **About**: A snapshot of my skills—photography, JavaScript, Django, and more.
- **Services**: Four cards covering Graphic Design, Web Development, Content Writing, and why I stand out.
- **Projects**: Three showcased works: photography, graphic design, and a live web project.
- **Contact**: Formspree-powered form + social links.

## Built With
- **HTML5**: Semantic and structured for accessibility.
- **CSS**: Flexbox-driven layout (`styles.css`) with Google Fonts (Lato, Poppins).
- **JavaScript**: Assumed interactivity via `script.js` (e.g., form validation).
- **Extras**: Font Awesome icons, custom favicon (`kym.png`), and images.

## Running It
1. Grab the repo: `git clone [https://github.com/K1man13/Kimani_Anthony.git]`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Check out the linked assets (`styles.css`, `script.js`, images).

## Highlights
- **Responsive**: Works on any device, thanks to Flexbox and viewport meta.
- **Projects**: Includes a live site ([Spread A Smile](https://spreadasmileorganization.vercel.app/)).
- **Versatility**: From logos to code, it’s all here.

## Why It Matters
This isn’t just a site—it’s proof I can design, code, and deliver. It’s my playground for experimenting with tech (Django, Node.js, Flutter) and creativity (photography, graphics).
